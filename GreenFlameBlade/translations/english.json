		"GFB_SLATE_INTRO_MAIN_OPTION_1": "Nevermind that, are you seeing that ringed planet up there?",
		"GFB_SLATE_INTRO_MAIN_OPTION_2": "What's up?",
		"GFB_SLATE_INTRO_RINGED_PLANET_1": "A planet with rings around it? Nope, never seen or heard of such a thing. Did you have a weird dream or something?",
		"GFB_SLATE_INTRO_RINGED_PLANET_2": "Anyway...",
		"GFB_SLATE_INTRO_COMPASS_1": "I know it's the translator tool's first time out in the field today too, but I've' been cooking up this new orienteering tool and want you to give it a test run.",
		"GFB_SLATE_INTRO_COMPASS_2": "It's kind of like your signalscope, but specifically for tracking exotic energy readings. Fire, radiation, spooky rocks, you name it.",
		"GFB_SLATE_INTRO_COMPASS_3": "Not ghost matter though; there's so much of that floating around in low concentrations that the readings would be useless.",
		"GFB_SLATE_INTRO_COMPASS_4": "Once the tool's locked in on a frequency, it'll continuously point towards the nearest source, wherever that happens to be. Not that useful for someone like me who stays put all day.",

		"GFB_SLATE_INTRO_OWLK_SAMPLE_2": "Whatever it is, it's giving off strong traces of electromagnetic radiation, so maybe you can use our \"compass\" to track down more of it.",
		"GFB_SLATE_INTRO_END_1": "Enough from me though, I'll let you get to it. I'm sure you'd rather see things for yourself rather than have this old geezer talk your ears off."
